Openbenchmarks - Open Source Benchmark Collection

There are a number of tried and true benchmarks that run great on embedded
systems, break drivers, useful for both QA and Performance Studies. With
a little modification and upgrades, these can be brought to a common level
of build with Autotools. This offers some consistent porting between
architetures, and some consistent execution as a suite.

1) Incorporate into OpenEmbedded, OE-Core.
2) Standalone build suite for GCC based Compilers.
3) Some m4 and script extensions to allow other compilers to be used.

These are primarily suited for systems running Linux, Cygwin/Windows, and
Embedded Linux.

If these are popular, a suite of microcontroller benchmarks can be done, but
with much smaller kernels, and radically different toolchains.
