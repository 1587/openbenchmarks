Iozone is actively maintained from iozone.org. Iozone is at Revision 3.397,  27-May-2011.
Version 3.397 is listed as both the latest version, and the stable version. 
This version reflects some recent changes provided by RedHat.

RedHat currently releases Iozone3 as part of EPEL 6. Iozone is listed as
deprecated in Fedora.

Iozone claims to be Open Source, but the license is not GPL or BSD.
It appears that it may have a history of BSD, since it mentions reagents. 

Iozone has placed restrictions on changes, needed for porting that have
caused it to be rejected by Debian Legal, and RedHat. 
Iozone allows distribution, but does not allow changes exept from the 
original author or those authorized by the author.

The Iozone package was removed from Fedora, and EPEL as the upstream declined 
to fix the license to make Iozone open source. The decision was made in 2008,
and after further review in 2011 the package has been removed from EPEL.

Debian Legal has also had problems with the Iozone license.

Openembedded adopted and recieved permission to distribute a 3.263 version
from 2006 with an ARM fix to the makefile. Part of the distribution was a
patch to be included in the next IOZone release, however the recipe has not
been updated to incorporate that patch.
