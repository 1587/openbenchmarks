This is a useful benchmark for function and performance. It is in
work, and the goal is to submit changes back to the author.

Two GIT repos are required, and loaded as submodules.
  git clone git://git.lttng.org/benchmarks.git
  git clone git://git.lttng.org/ust.git

Hi William,

Except the fact that it produces a warning because the probe is empty,
the results differ a little but not as much as I expected. I also tested
(in flight recorder mode) with just removing the gettimeofday_ns() call
(and printing) :

# of threads   With printf    Without gtod_ns()   Without printf
1              0:58.36        0:52.27             0:46.45
2              1:49.94        1:37.61             1:27.33
4              2:38.49        2:35.13             2:50.87

For those who want to play with the benchmark, we setup a git repository
here : git://git.lttng.org/benchmarks.git

If you have any suggestions or ideas to make these tests better, we'll
be happy to integrate it.

Thanks,

Julien
